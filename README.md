# Utility CRDT data structures for Javascript

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are a class of data structures designed to guarantee strong eventual consistency in a distributed environment.

This library is intended to act as a repository of composable (state-based) CRDTs to help with building more complicated CRDTs in other applications. It is, unfortunately, poorly defined and barely tested and will probably break. Use it at your own will.
